Alice and Bob met while they were doing a spacewalk close to their command modules. They belonged to different planets and that made them special, really special. Alice was from Solid1 and Bob from Core1. Solid1 was dangerously close to `Void`, the only black hole in their galaxy. Core1 on the other hand was 0.3 light years away from `Void`. Naturally due to time dilation, time would run slower on Alice's planet Solid1. One minute in Solid1 was equivalent to 1 day in Core1. Alice and Bob found a way to exploit this behaviour. For any data processing activities or any compute heavy activities that had to be done by Alice, Alice would send the data to Bob. Bob with the same level of technology would complete the task in n number of days but to Alice, this was just n number of minutes. Cool right!!! There was one problem though, Bob just had one super computer to process the data, so any time data came, Bob would put it in a queue; any time he needed more data, he would wait for Alice to send the data. This was not working well because of one super computer so Alice's team started pursuing for more such Bobs in their galaxy!!!

The little story in the beginning is actually well aligned with the purpose of the language itself and what problems this language aims to solve.
Every component in the story is a reference to a component in any computer system. Can you match the computer systems/concepts with the story components!!!
Your options are: CPU cycle, IO and cores
